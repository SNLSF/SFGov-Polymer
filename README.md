# SFGov-Polymer

## A data visualization project using Polymer

For this project, I utilized the Google Polymer Paper Elements catalog for the checkboxes as well as the Web Component catalog for Google maps.  

## Objectives of this project:

* Build an interactive data mashup

* Use one of San Francisco's great open datasets: https://data.sfgov.org

* Avoid additional libraries and focus on CSS & Javascript

* Consider cross-browser support

* Use Polymer



## Stretch Goals:

* Show more than one view of the data
